                                The guidance has already existed for a while,
                                and the management taking actions, the situation
                                is not getting better. Simply not enough
                                (struggling) students, will go to their educational
                                advisors or teachers for that.

                                One of my main goals is to implement a workshop
                                for students on how to be receptable for friends
                                who are struggling, and then how to redirect
                                them to professional help, alongside with
                                holding more information sessions about the
                                professional help available.

                                Last year, as Head of PR, I gathered a website
                                team and managed to get a CDE website up and
                                running, despite fighting privacy concerns,
                                logistics and team management.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second part of this operation has already
                                been put into play, and has been verified that
                                it is both legally possible (with privacy
                                concerns), and logistically possible to display
                                absent teachers on the CDE website. There are
                                two steps left before we in theory can display
                                absent teachers on our website.

                                Last year, I helped map out a relax zone, as
                                well as completely alone 3D modelled the
                                interior space, including bean bags, couches,
                                tables and even a small kitchen type of area.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This has been approved by the management, and is
                                certainly achievable and possible to implement
                                in the near future already.

                                I would also like to add more comfortable
                                seating, such as couches/ sofas, in the preaus
                                and other spaces around the school.

                                The gap, between the CDE and the students, is
                                too large. A big goal of mine is encouraging
                                and empowering the students, ultimately easing
                                the process for everyone to get involved in
                                school matters, and ie. start competitions, help
                                organize events or fight for change within the
                                school. The CDE shall simply act as a bridge
                                between the students & management, and help with
                                technicalities if necessary.

                                Not only does this give a fair chance to
                                everyone to help if they want to, but it
                                increases the (unfortunately none existent)
                                school spirit. A big priority of mine is to make
                                sure all years feel equally included, which
                                means i want to ensure the younger years get the
                                inclusion they have been lacking.

                                The entrance/exit queues are quite ridiculous,
                                and ought to be reduced. I believe this is
                                certainly something that is achievable, even
                                within a reasonably short period of time. There
                                are several options, which are all viable, and
                                will be put into action as soon as possible
                                after the elections.

                                I’m confident the queue time will be able to be
                                decreased and the process eased.

                                In making the school a more comfortable
                                environment, doing what you love is essential,
                                that includes sports too. Especially if it can
                                get slightly challenging or competitive. That’s
                                why I want to make sure competitions and
                                tournaments are made, in various categories such
                                as sports, arts, writing, gaming and debating.
                                Here is also where I welcome all students to
                                come to the CDE with your suggestions, help and
                                feedback, so we can include everybody’s

                        <p>
                            I’m an extremely extroverted person, with a lot of
                            passion and energy! I enjoy doing sports, working
                            out, public speaking and gaming. I’ve been in this
                            school and served the school community for several
                            years, as President of the Media Club, member of the
                            CDE, Climate Academy and co-founder of CoSup Gaming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve got a strong mentality, focusing a lot on self
                            improvement. That’s also why I love fighting for
                            change in the CDE, as I will do whatever it takes to
                            win. I’ve got a warrior mindset, and won’t stop
                            until I’ve either won, or given my everything.
                            That’s why I can confidently promise you I will be a
                            president who will try and fight as hard as they
                            can, for you.
